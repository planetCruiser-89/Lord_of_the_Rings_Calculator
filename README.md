# Lord_of_the_Rings_Calculator
A calculator to fill in the time.

Still under progress.

This calculator takes user input and depending on if you want to watch the theatrical releases or the extended editions and tells you if you can watch the trilogy, or a combination of movies. 

The one ring o the page was maticuously created letter by letter, span by span. 

Links to media platforms will be provided for individuals viewing preference.

To cut time on creating each span I created an automated javascript algorithm that printed the html elements, as well as the css properties.
